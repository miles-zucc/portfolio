      <div className="project-description">
        Hunts Office is the largest furniture showroom in the U.K. As part of an
        internship at Graphical House, Glasgow, I designed the website on a
        strict grid to reflect the brandâ€™s ethos, complete with a particular
        emphasis on transitions and subtle animations throughout. The tools used
        were Sketch, InvisionApp, Tachyons, Craftyons, Javacript, Animate.css,
        CSS3 animations.
